              <p class="text-left">Clinical trials are used to test the safety and efficacy of drugs and medical devices.  Typically a clinical trial has four phases:  Phase one: generally healthy people are given a medication or intervention to determine if there are any adverse or toxic effects; Phase two and three: look more closely at safety and effectiveness while honing in on route of administration, dosage, and frequency (after phase three is when the FDA would approve a drug or device); and Phase four: examines new uses for previously approved treatments.</p>

              <p class="text-left">Every year the biopharmaceutical industry spends billions of dollars to sponsor thousands of clinical trials involving over a million patients across the US.  In a capitalist system an investment of this magnitude must result in tangible returns for the companies sponsoring the process.  Much of that return on investment occurs when a drug or device goes to market, but how much value does a Phase 3 clinical trial bring to their sponsors?</p>

              <p class="text-left">The goal of this project is to create a dataset that can be analyzed for insights in to some of these questions:</p>  

              <p class="text-left">Are clinical trials profitable?  What companies have paid for clinical trials?  How does the completion of a clinical trial effect the sponsoring company's stock price (value) in the following weeks?  Should the type of clinical trial be considered during analysis?</p>
